## Introduction

Slate is a simple modular library to represent Steam trade offers using [`@automatedtf/sherpa`](https://github.com/automatedtf/sherpa) in a standardised format called an `OfferArtifact`.

This is done by taking the `TradeOffer` object from [`steam-tradeoffer-manager`](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager) and (minimally) populating the item-related fields to describe an item instance's semantic details using Sherpa.
