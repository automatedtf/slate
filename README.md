## Introduction

Slate is a simple modular library to represent Steam trade offers or `TradeOffer` from `steam-tradeoffer-manager` using `@automatedtf/sherpa` in a standardised format.

This takes the `TradeOffer` object and either asks for additional fields (such as `steamid` of the client) or will populate item-related fields itself using `@automatedtf/sherpa`.
